Just as the FDA regulates and oversees the safety, effectiveness and quality of
*vaccines*, there needs to be an FDA for *algorithms*. This is one of the take-aways
of the 90 minute film *Coded Bias*.

With the rise of big-data and AI over the past 20 years, the myriad ways in which human
decision making has been slowly replaced with software algorithms is both mind boggling
and alarming. Today, software driven decision making is used everywhere from law
enforcement, to lending, to college admissions, to medical diagnosis and treatment, to
jury selection and sentencing and more. Bias in such software has the potential to impact
the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans in profound ways.

The film focuses on
[the work](https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212) of
[Joy Buolamwini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Buolamwini), founder of the
[Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org) in analyzing facial recognition software.
Buolamwini's testimony before Congress last year helped bring to light many of the serious social justice ills
exacerbated by bias in algorithms. In part, as a result of Buolamwini's work,
[Amazon recently announced a pause](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/we-are-implementing-a-one-year-moratorium-on-police-use-of-rekognition)
in the police use of its facial recognition software and
[Congress proposed a ban](https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-merkley-and-reps-jayapal-pressley-to-introduce-legislation-to-ban-government-use-of-facial-recognition-other-biometric-technology)
on facial recognition software.

The film showcases Buolamwini's work and describes several others, gives several examples of bias
in AI and how that bias negatively impacts the lives of real people. It also describes cases
where big-data algorithms have demonstrated an ability to abruptly influence the real world behavior
of millions of individuals. Buolamwini warns that algorithmic justice poses a great threat to
civil rights. The film is informative and thought-provoking and well worth the time to view. It
is an especially useful resource for anyone in HPC/CSE looking to add to their Inclusion toolbox.

It can be viewed at a number of [virtual cinemas](https://www.codedbias.com/virtualcinema). There
is a [free screening](https://www.meetup.com/AI-LA-Meetup/events/274929071/) available until
December 14th.
