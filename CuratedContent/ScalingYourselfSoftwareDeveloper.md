In the video *[Scaling Yourself as a Software Devloper](http://blog.martinig.ch/videos/scaling-yourself-as-a-software-developer/)*,
Scott Hanselman helps software developers (and others) prioritize productive work, minimize interruptions (by self and others), have productive work sprints, and organize and schedule necessary but possibly time-consuming tasks such as email. He includes suggestions for planning your day and beyond so that you don't become entangled or driven by other factors. After watching this video and implementing a few of his recommendations, you may find yourself breaking an "urgency" addiction and moving towards real productivity. At the very least your inbox will be cleared out quickly and the number of open browser windows will shrink. Productivity ideas and tools are suggested in the video such as using a personal kanban and occasionally syncing to paper. The video also suggests tools you can use to organize activities that might interrupt your productive software development time, that you would like to do later, such as using a service like *Instapaper* to organize sites to read later.  The video is entertaining and may even prompt me to get a pomodoro; watch the video to find out why.
