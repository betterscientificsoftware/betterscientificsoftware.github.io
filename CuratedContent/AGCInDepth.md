For the 50th Anniversary of Apollo 11, [BSSw.io](https://bssw.io) hosted a
[3 part blog series](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/celebrating-apollo-s-50th-anniversary-when-100-flops-watt-was-a-giant-leap)
describing the development of the
[Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer).
This past October marked the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 14 mission as
it was originally planned before investigations into Apollo 13 delayed it.

Those who found the blog series interesting may want to read this recent article by
Apollo historian [Frank O'Brien](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/franko.html)
providing an in-depth description of the AGC architecture and the *hack* that
saved the Apollo 14 mission.
This article is probably the best and most detailed description of the AGC
hardware available on line short of buying the book,
[The Apollo Guidance Computer Architecture and Operation](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781441908766) also authored
by Frank O'Brien or pouring over the original, [1960s era documentation](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/).
