### Collaborations Workshop 2021

The Software Sustainability Institute invites all members of the research software community to explore and discuss the themes described above and other related issues at CW21.

CW21 participants will gain insight into the topics of FAIR Research Software, Diversity and Inclusion, and Software Sustainability and how these impact on research. It is also an ideal opportunity to form collaborations (on average, CW participants start two new collaborations by attending) and to discuss topics proposed by attendees. CW21 is a great place to network and participants will meet many of the new and existing [Software Sustainability Institute Fellows] (https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows?_ga=2.89454747.1030417516.1607984078-920709310.1607984078) â€“ key ambassadors in varied research domains.

### Submissions

Mini-workshop and demo sessions offer unique opportunities for CW21 participants and sponsors to give an in-depth look at a particular tool or approach relating to research software. We are looking for sessions connected to one or more of the CW21 themes - FAIR Research Software, Diversity and Inclusion, and Software Sustainability - in particular, but are happy to consider any proposals involving research software. Proposals can also be related to pitches for the CW21 Hack Day.

CW21 is also calling for submissions for participant-led social activities to take place during our social programme! Ideas can include a netoworking or social activity, a board game night, a yoga or mediation session, a Bird of a Feather session, or any other suggestions.

The deadline for submissions is 23:59 GMT on Sunday, 31 January 2021. Applicants will be notified of the outcomes by 12 February 2021.
