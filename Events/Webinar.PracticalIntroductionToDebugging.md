The mission of the Sustainable Horizons Institute is to build sustainable, inclusive connections between students, faculty, and professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  

**Description:**  The webinar series of the [Sustainable Horizons Institute](http://shinstitute.org/) proudly presents: "A Practical Introduction to Debugging" Join us on **Friday, August 24th, 2018 from 2:00 pm -- 3:00 pm CST**. We are privileged to have Jeremy Melvin host a webinar on debugging. During this webinar, you will learn about strategies for handling bugs in your software, tools to aid in debugging, such as GDB (GNU Debugger) and other resources, and the opportunity to take part in an interactive debugging session using GDB. 

Jeremy Melvin is an ICES postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin. He received his Ph.D in Computational Applied Mathematics from Stony Brook University. His research interests are focused on developing tools and models to improve the predictive capabilities of numerical simulations for turbulent flows in complex engineering problems.

Advance registration is required through the event website.
